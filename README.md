# Shortest Vector Problem in C++

You can find here the code from my SVP paper in my Paper-Collection repository, [here](https://github.com/Dergg/Paper-Collection/blob/main/SVP_with_Cpp.pdf)

This paper also details my thinking throughout and the methods used to find an approximation to the Shortest Vector Problem, namely LLL-reduction and Schnorr-Euchner enumeration.
